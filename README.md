# Pomodoro Clock (Service Worker version)

A demo of my [Codepen Pomodoro Clock](https://codepen.io/jhkueh/full/mVwJaE/), but utilising service worker to cache audio file for offline use. It will also remember your timer settings for next visit (unless reset).

Built with Vue.js 2, Bootstrap, Font Awesome & Animate.css.
